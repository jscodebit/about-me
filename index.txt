Hello everyone, this is Soujanya Janapatla. I am passionate in exploring the ceaseless possibilities the web can offer, with over 6 years of experience in software development on Web-based UI technologies, along with good UX understanding. Currently a first semester student of Masters in Applied Computer Science.

I am from Hyderabad, India. I took my initial steps in to programming while I worked as an intern during my under-graduation at a small firm named Fanatic Systems, where we conducted workshops for Engineering students showcasing games designed using programming languages such as Java and Javascript frameworks. Along the way, I developed interest to become proficient in fields such as UX Design and Big Data Analytics.

I firmly believe technology is making the world a better place to live, and I’m looking forward to being part of that journey.

In my free time I like brainstorming with new technologies and keep a collection of my learning at my blog. Apart from this I love traveling and make new friends, tiny little paintings,  Also I enjoy cooking the most.

Sketching and Illustration are my new hobby that I’m learning.
