            <h2>Currently, Graduate Student at NorthWest Missouri State University</h2>
            <section>Hello everyone, this is Soujanya Janapatla. I am passionate in exploring the ceaseless
                possibilities the web can offer, with over 6 years of experience in software development on Web-based UI
                technologies, along with good UX understanding. Currently a first semester student of Masters in Applied

                I am from Hyderabad, India. I took my initial steps in to programming while I worked as an intern during
                my under-graduation at a small firm named Fanatic Systems, where we conducted workshops for Engineering
                students showcasing games designed using programming languages such as Java and Javascript frameworks.
                Along the way, I developed interest to become proficient in fields such as UX Design and Big Data
                Analytics.

                I firmly believe technology is making the world a better place to live, and I’m looking forward to being
                part of that journey.

                In my free time I like brainstorming with new technologies and keep a collection of my learning at my
                blog. Apart from this I love traveling and make new friends, tiny little paintings, Also I enjoy cooking
                the most.

                Sketching and Illustration are my new hobby that I’m learning.
